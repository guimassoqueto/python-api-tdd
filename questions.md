1. What is the meaning of the variable `PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1` in the Dockerfile?
  >Setting PYTHONUNBUFFERED to a non-empty value different from 0 ensures that the python output i.e. the stdout and stderr streams are sent straight to terminal (e.g. your container log) without being first buffered and that you can see the output of your application (e.g. django logs) in real time.
2. Inside the *compose.yaml* what is the args inside `services.app.build.args`? [The command replaces the DEV arg inside the Dockerfile]
